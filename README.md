# django-with-react-ecommerce
An Ecommerce Django with React application created as part of my Diploma in Software Development course through Yoobee Colleges

I created this application by following Dennis Ivy's Django with React Udemy tutorial. This experience has allowed me to learn and experience React, Django framework, Redux state management, and my first application where the frontend is making API calls to the backend

Django Rest Framework
React and Redux State Management - useState, useEffect, useLocation, dispatch

To run this application you can:

1. Create a virtual environment and install the Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file
2. Makemigrations and Migrate the models onto a database (in this case SQLite only)
3. Run the backend server (python manage.py runserver)
4. Install npm and start frontend application (npm start)
